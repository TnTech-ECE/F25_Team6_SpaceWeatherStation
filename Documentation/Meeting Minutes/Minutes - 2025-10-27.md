# Meeting Information

| Date: | 10/27/25 |
| Time: | 3:30PM |
| Location: | iMaker Space |
| Meeting Called By: | Team Consensus |
| Note Taker: | Nolan Magee |

# Attendees

Jack Bender, Kenneth Creamer, Blake Hudson, Nolan Magee, Jackson Taylor

# Agenda

- Jack giving a presentation on goals for team after we receive conceptual design back
- Talk about Gantt chart and the progression completion for the rest of this semester and next semester

# Discussion

- Jack opened with presentation
  - Discussed powering SBC with a pin
  - Discussed sampling rate options and how the data will be outputted, introducing additional complications
  - Making responsibilities for Jackson and Blake more general to include some overlap
- Kenny talked about different options for stepping down voltage (voltage divider, mosfet, device from amazon)
  - Potentially using SBC as the stepdown
- Nolan talking through the Gantt chart
  - Ask Dr. storm about if tax should be included in our budget
  - Ask Dr. Storm about ordering parts early
  - Is the detail design all in one document
  - Is the design presentation just presenting detailed design?
- Questions for Owen
  - What's the best way of providing a stable power rail (SBC or designated power rail)

Meeting with Owen

- MCU and SBC
  - Everything should be possible on the MCU (increases difficulty) (cuts cost and power consumption)
- Rasberry pi 5
  - Consider zero 2w, pi 4, or pi3 as alternatives
- Having an OLED attached to the prototype for displaying system readouts
- Battery
  - Consider sealed lead acid battery as an alternative to lithium ion (everything is cheaper and requires less safety but increases weight)
- Enclosure
  - Can underclock components to decrease heat
  - If more heat is being generated, a heat sink is worth consideration
- Sensors
  - Magnetometer can be digital
- Interfacing with the u-block
  - Recommended using UART
- Lora transceiver for transmitting signals (probably multi-directional)

# Decisions Made

- Reach back out to Dr. Austen and see about meeting next week
- Include LORA transceiver in prototype design
- Change battery from lithium ion to sealed lead acid battery
