| Time: | 3:30 PM |
| Location: | AIEB 374 |
| Meeting Called By: | Team Consensus |
| Note Taker: | Nolan Magee |

# Attendees

Jack Bender, Jackson Taylor, Kenneth Creamer, Blake Hudson, Nolan Magee

# Agenda

- Discuss conceptual design and assign sub-system roles

# Discussion

- Blake gave an overview of conceptual design and some potential designs moving forward
  - Idea 1: System with u-block, raspberry pi 5 and ESP
    - Benefits: easy access to data (server on the phone)
    - Challenge: more complicated, greater potential for breakdown
  - Idea 2: System with raspberry pi 5 and u-block without ESP
    - Benefits: all-in-one unit
    - Down-side: learn how to make a server using raspberry pi 5
- Decided to move forward with Idea 2 as a group

- Discussed what sub-systems need to be developed
  - Software

Meeting with Owen O'Connor

- He asked, "What level of sensitivity would we need to pickup and process the information we're receiving?" "What is the PPM of measurement?
  - Using the u-block creates the processing and focus for signals
- Talked about our project in regard to embedded systems
  - He asked, "would we need a pi 5?"
    - He proposed the raspberry pi zero 2 w
      - Cheaper, no hdmi output, doesn't have the pcie interface. Could still word with an sd card. Power to usb (creates access by using usb serial, no graphical applications)
      - Has the same gpio outputs as most other raspberry pi, wifi and Bluetooth capable
      - Doesn't have a low power mode
- Question about sample rate
  - 1-10 seconds seems to be appropriate (could be accomplished by the pi zero)
- He asked how quickly the TEC values changes
  - Change is relatively slow and somewhat random
- Processing data from satellites
  - Taking a screenshot from all visible satellites with a certain time stamp to be processed all together
- Signal processing will be the most challenging part
  - "expect to run into integration hell" - Owen
- For modularity
  - Quick connector (PCB connector)
  - Exposed gpio pins
  - Rtlsdr
  - RPI hat for raspberry pi (look into variations of this)
  - Have a chip capable of putting gnu radio on
- Conversation about subsystems
  - Don't worry about thermal load for enclosure
  - Combine power with sensors
- Safety systems
  - Resettable fuse
  - Complex model of detecting thermal runaway before it starts
  - For temperature sensor (most have analog outputs)(pi doesn't have analog input)

# Action Items

- Talk to Dr. Coster \[Blake Hudson\]
- Look at what subsystems need support
- Plan for responsibilities in conceptual design documentation
- Figure out a process for having Owen review our conceptual design documentation
