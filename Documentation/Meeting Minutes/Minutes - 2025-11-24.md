# Agenda

- Go over team budget
- Check-in with everyone to see if anyone needs help completing their section

# Discussion

- Individual budgets
  - Blake (175.52)(overbudget)
  - Kenny (\$314.83)(overbudget)
  - Jack (\$114)(overbudget)
  - Jackson (\$351.04)(within budget)
  - Nolan (\$109.7)(overbudget)
- Current total expense (\$1,065.09)
- To keep our project under \$1,000, we will categorize some expenses as stretch goals. This will achieve a base functional prototype while not sacrificing the goal to exemplify the prototypes range of operation.
  - List of stretch goal components (Solar panel, Magnetometer, LoRa module)
  - This brings the base model down to approximately \$935
